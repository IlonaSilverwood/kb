John MacFarlane, creator of pandoc and coauthor of the CommonMark spec,
designed "Djot". Published in July 2022, Djot is a new markup language
that is similar to Markdown, but more principled in many ways. Parse and
produce djot files with pandoc via the custom reader and custom writer
included in the repository. https://djot.net/
