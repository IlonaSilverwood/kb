The "csquotes" TeXLaTeX package provides advanced facilities for inline
and display quotations. The package has excellent support for different
languages, too. Set the `csquotes` variable to make pandoc use this
package when rendering quotes. For best results, set the `lang` variable
as well. E.g., the first output below was created with pandoc -o a.pdf
and the second with pandoc -o a.pdf -V csquotes pandoc l10n
