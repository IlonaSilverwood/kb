Three methods to add a comment to pandoc Markdown texts:

1.  ``` markdown
    <!-- HTML comment; will show up in HTML output,
         unless suppressed with `--strip-comments` -->
    ```

2.  ``` markdown
    ---
    # YAML block with comment.
    # Always removed.
    ---
    ```

3.  ~~~ markdown
    ``` {=comment}
    Creative use of raw blocks.
    Included in md output, dropped everywhere else.
    ```
    ~~~
