Pandoc supports many extensions for Common mark; pandoc version 2.10.1
introduced the "commonmark_x" format, which is the standardized
CommonMark plus a default set of useful extensions. This includes
support for YAML blocks, fancy lists, syntax for divs and spans, and
many other extensions that are part of pandoc's Markdown.

CommonMark_x is *almost* a drop-in replacement. Citations are the
exception, they haven't been implemented yet.
