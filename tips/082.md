JOSS, the [Journal of Open Source Software][joss], is now [in the
fediverse]. The journal is remarkable for multiple reasons, with one
reason being that papers are authored in Markdown and processed by
pandoc.

Of course, all of the journal's systems are open source. E.g., the
publishing pipeline is available here:
https://github.com/openjournals/inara The pipeline currently produces
PDF, JATS, and Crossref XML output.

For more info on the joss publishing pipeline, esp. the JATS generation,
see this article https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK579698/ and the
