## Presentation slides

Pandoc supports multiple slide formats, thereby enabling quick-and-easy
creation of presentations. The most popular choices are probably
`--to=beamer` for mathy and content-heavy slides, `--to=revealjs` for
less-formal talks, and `--to=powerpoint` when the company requires it.
