It is good practice to set the document language, e.g. via `lang`
metadata field on the command line pandoc -M lang=de-DE This allows for
proper hyphenation and other improvements; e.g. headers in TeXLaTeX PDFs
will be localized, with translations for "Figure", "Table of Contents"
and similar labels. Or put it directly into the doc; e.g. in Markdown
one can use a YAML block --- lang: es --- and in Orgmode #+language: fr

pandoc l10n
