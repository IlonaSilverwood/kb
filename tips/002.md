If you're tired of Markdown code blocks written with braces and
dots for the language, we have a solution for you: use `--to markdown-fenced_code_attributes` to show the language
without a dot or braces.

`{.python} print("hello")`

will turn into

`python print("hello")`,

which is much easier on the eyes.
