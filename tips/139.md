"Pandoc-discuss" is pandoc's official mailing list:
https://groups.google.com/g/pandoc-discuss. It is the central point of
contact for pandoc users and devs; use it for any questions about
pandoc.

The web interface is misleading in that it makes it seem like a Google
account is required to post. However, it's enough to write a mail to
<pandoc-discuss+subscribe@googlegroups.com> to subscribe to the list with
any mail address. support mailing list
