Underline text in different lightweight markup languages:

Emacs Org mode :orgmode:, Muse: *this*

Doku wiki: **this**

Textile, Jira +this+

There is no Markdown syntax for underlined text, but pandoc's Markdown
reader treats the content of spans with class "underline" or "ul" as
underlined:

    [important]{.underline}
    [nota bene]{.ul}
