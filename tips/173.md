Pandoc ships with 8 syntax highlighting styles: pygments (the default),
tango, espresso, zenburn, kate, monochrome, breezedark, and haddock. Set
`--highlight-style` to one of these values to vary code coloring etc.
Not enough? Pandoc can also use KDE highlighting themes. There's a list
at https://kate-editor.org/themes/, theme files are available from
https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting/tree/master/data/themes. Pass
the downloaded file as highlight style. syntax highlighting theme
