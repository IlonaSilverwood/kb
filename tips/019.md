## Markdown as a simpler LaTeX

Markdown can be used as a simpler LaTeX, but with the raw power of
TeX still available when targeting PDF. TeX commands can be embedded in
Markdown; the options `--natbib`/`--biblatex` are available for when
pandoc's citation handling via CSL isn't powerful enough for once.
