Con te xt is an advanced typesetting system based on TeX; it's the
preferred system of many professional typesetters. Pandoc can convert to
ConTeXt markup with `--to=context` and generate PDF files via ConTeXt
with `--pdf-engine=context`. The system makes it possible to generate
accessible, tagged PDFs, which is otherwise difficult to do:

    pandoc --pdf-engine=context -V pdfa=3a ...

ConTeXt in the fediverse: @context.
