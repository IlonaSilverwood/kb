Two ways to get a hard linebreak within a paragraph with Markdown:

1.  End the line with two spaces (most portable).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    I want a linebreak after this.␠␠
    This is a new line.

2.  "Backslash escape" the linebreak (more readable).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    I want a linebreak after this.\
    This is a new line.

Both methods work with pandoc and any Common mark processor.
